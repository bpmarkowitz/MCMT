# HDHomeRun MCMT
Multi Channel Modifier Tool (MCMT) is a simple tool for the SiliconDust HDHomeRun to let you quickly disable all SD or DRM channels.

- This was like 10 minute hack, and I'm not a coder.
- Use at your own risk.
- This only works if you have one HDHomeRun.

## How it works
- Download the repo.
- Go the downloaded folder and find the index.html file
- drag the index.html into your web browser.
- Follow the directions on your screen.
