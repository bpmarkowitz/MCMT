# HDHomeRun MCMT
Multi Channel Modifier Tool (MCMT) is a simple tool for the SiliconDust HDHomeRun to let you quickly disable all SD or DRM channels.

- This was like 10 minute hack.
- Use at your own risk, but it should be easy to revert any changes you make.
- This only works if you have one HDHomeRun.
